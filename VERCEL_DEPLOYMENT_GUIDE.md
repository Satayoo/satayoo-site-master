```bash
./deploy-to-vercel.sh
```

### Option C: Direct Deployment with Defaults

# For preview deployment
vercel --yes

# For production deployment
vercel --prod --yes
```

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

After deployment, go to your Vercel dashboard:

1. Visit [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
4. Add these variables:
   ```

   REACT_APP_AI_API_KEY = your_api_key
   ```
5. Redeploy for changes to take effect

## Step 4: Access Your Deployed App

After deployment, you'll get URLs like:
- Preview: `https://satayoo-agentic-xxxxx.vercel.app`
- Production: `https://satayoo-agentic.vercel.app`

Your AI tool will be available at:
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/agentic`

## Step 5: Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)

To use satayoo.com:

1. In Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. Add `satayoo.com` or `agentic.satayoo.com`
3. Configure DNS:
   - Add CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
   - Or A records to Vercel's IPs
4. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

## Alternative: Deploy via GitHub

If you prefer GitHub integration:

1. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Agentic AI tool"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Import from GitHub in Vercel:
   - Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Click "Import Git Repository"
   - Select your repository
   - Configure and deploy

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
- Verify environment variables are set

### If routing doesn't work:
- Check that vercel.json has rewrite rules
- Clear browser cache
- Try incognito mode

### If AI responses don't work:
- Verify environment variables in Vercel
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure API endpoint is accessible
