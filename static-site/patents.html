      <h2>Rally AI Patent</h2>
      <p>
        The Rally AI system is a modular robotics platform designed for realistic sports training.
        It features an omnidirectional mobile base, 4+ DOF striking arms and stereo/depth vision
        to track balls in real time. An onboard compute unit runs physics simulations and
        reinforcement learning algorithms that adapt difficulty based on the user’s skill level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Training data is logged to the cloud, where user profiles are synced and personalised
        coaching plans are generated. Whether you’re practising table tennis, tennis or other
        racket sports, Rally AI provides consistent, adjustable training without needing a human
        partner.

      <h2>Agentic Multi‑Agent Platform</h2>
      <p>
        Satayoo’s Agentic platform is a development environment for building networks of cooperating
        AI agents. A visual graph interface lets you design workflows, while a built‑in execution
        engine simulates inter‑agent planning and messaging. Agents share a contextual memory layer
        that they query and update dynamically, enabling complex multi‑step tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform includes an orchestration layer and SDK, making it extensible for bespoke
        applications. Current use cases include customer service networks, collaborative software
        engineering, legal research and automated workflow automation.
