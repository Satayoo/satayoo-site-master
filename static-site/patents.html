      <h2>Rally AI Patent</h2>
      <p>
        The Rally AI system is a modular robotics platform designed for realistic sports training. It features
        an omnidirectional mobile base, 4+ DOF striking arms and stereo/depth vision to track balls in real
        time. An onboard compute unit runs physics simulations and reinforcement learning algorithms that
        adapt difficulty based on the user’s skill level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Training data is logged to the cloud, where user profiles are synced and personalised coaching plans
        are generated. Whether you’re practising table tennis, tennis or other racket sports, Rally AI
        provides consistent, adjustable training without needing a human partner.

      <h2>Agentic Multi‑Agent Platform</h2>
      <p>
        Satayoo’s Agentic platform is a development environment for building networks of cooperating AI
        agents. A visual graph interface lets you design workflows, while a built‑in execution engine
        simulates inter‑agent planning and messaging. Agents share a contextual memory layer that they query
        and update dynamically, enabling complex multi‑step tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform includes an orchestration layer and SDK, making it extensible for bespoke applications.
        Current use cases include customer service networks, collaborative software engineering, legal
        research and automated workflow automation.

      <h2>Autonomous Swarm Navigation Patent</h2>
      <p>
        Our autonomous swarm navigation technology enables fleets of drones and ground robots to move as a
        cohesive group. Each unit uses onboard sensors and decentralized algorithms to maintain formation,
        avoid collisions and adapt to dynamic obstacles without relying on a central controller.
      </p>
      <p>
        This patent covers our real‑time path planning and communication protocols that allow hundreds of
        agents to navigate complex environments efficiently. Applications include search‑and‑rescue missions,
        precision agriculture and automated warehouses where coordination and reliability are paramount.
